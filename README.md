Because performance is priority in this project we decided to render the game client side and only send keystrokes over websocket to backend for broadcasting.

We recognize this opens up for the possibility of the client to manipulate the game state, but expect it to work as expected during the normal use case.


# Usage
Go to backend and start server with go run .

Then connect to localhost:8080 with your browser.

Control with arrow keys and drop bomb on shift
